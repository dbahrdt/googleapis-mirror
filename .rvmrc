rvm ruby-1.8.7

# Rbenv is the recommended ruby version manager, but providing this for RVM
# users.

# RVM is stuck on ruby 1.8.7 with RVM because of issues with sudo on ruby 1.9
# in conjunction with RVM. If anyone can confirm this is fixed, feel free to
# sumit a pull-request to bump the ruby version for RVM.

# See https://github.com/rmm5t/googleapis-mirror/commit/eab96a9af9c695f4e657b431a720439edd603bc0
